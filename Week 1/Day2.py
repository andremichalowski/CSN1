**********  PROBLEM SOLVING ****************

U.P.E.R.

1. UNDERSTAND:

Before doing anything else, make sure you understand precisely what the problem is asking. A helpful starting point could be transcribing the technical description of the problem into your own words.

Questions
Here is a list of starter questions that might come up during this step:

What are the inputs your code receives?
What is the range of the input?
How big can the input be (how much data)?
What are the outputs your code produces?
What is the range of the output?
How big can the output be (how much data)?
How performant must the code be?
Is there anything missing from the task description that needs to be clarified?
What assumptions are you making?
Does anyone else on the team need to validate these assumptions?

2. PLAN:
This step is where you will ask, "what steps will I take to solve the problem?" You will take your description of the problem and transform it into a complete, actionable plan to solve that problem. If you realize you still don't truly understand the problem while planning, return to Understand until you resolve the ambiguity. If you have not yet completed Understand, you will end up planning to solve the wrong problem! When interviewing, you must do this step aloud!

Remember, you aren’t coding during this step unless it’s a small piece of throwaway code to test a hypothesis. It would be best if you wrote pseudocode during this step, however.

Questions
Do you know the answer to a similar problem that has comparable inputs and outputs?
Does this problem remind you an anything else?
Can you bring that knowledge to bear here?
Does my plan meet the performance requirements?
What’s the time complexity?
What’s the space complexity?
How big can my input data be?
Can sorting the input data ahead of time lead to any improvements in time complexity?
Does recursion help?
Is the problem made up of identical subproblems?
Can you state the problem with itself in its definition?
Think like a villain. Does your plan cover the edge cases?

3. EXECUTE:
This step is where you take your plan and convert it to actual working code. This step isn’t easy, but it’s much easier if you've done an excellent job with the "Understand" and "Plan" steps above. If you find shortcomings in your plan while implementing the solution, return to the "Plan" phase until you resolve the ambiguity. If you have not yet completed the "Plan" step, you will spend far longer on the "Execute" step than you have to.

Questions
Think like a villain. Does your implementation handle all inputs?
What is the best way to split this code into separate functions or classes?
Does this functionality already exist?
Are there built-in libraries I can leverage?
Are there third-party libraries I can leverage?

4. REFLECT:
The primary question you are dealing with during this step is — "is this implementation as good as I can make it?" Would I be proud to show my code to another programmer?

Questions
Does your solution work in all cases?
Main case?
Edge cases?
Is the solution performant enough?
Is the code documented?
In retrospect, what would you do differently? What will you do differently next time?
What went right?
What went wrong?

********** ASKING FOR HELP ********** 

Overview
The necessary action when asking a question is to imagine that you are trying to answer your question. Because you are deep in your problem's weeds, it's easy to forget that the person who answers your question does not have all the context. We should keep this general rule in mind — it's the overarching rule for all the details we go into next.

Search and Research
Before you do anything else, search for a solution to your problem on your own. One thing you should start doing is keeping track of all your research when solving a problem. One easy way to do this is to have a browser window represent a specific search for a solution, and each open tab represents an attempt at solving it. Keeping track of your research is vital because it's helpful to provide examples of similar questions or similar problems and explain why those didn't answer your specific problem or question. It also helps the person answering your question avoid pointing you toward resources you've already explored, and lets them know that you've already put in the work.

Introduce the Problem
The first thing you do when you ask a question￼￼￼￼ is to introduce the problem. The first paragraph of your written question should serve as an executive summary of the problem. All the following paragraphs should fill in the details of the problem.

An important thing to include in your problem introduction is a precise explanation of how you encountered the problem. Write about the difficulties that kept you from solving it. Describe what you already tried and include the results of the research you've done.

You should also provide as much detail about the context as possible. For instance, include the language version, the platform version, the operating system, the database type, specific IDE, and any web server information. You should also include your particular constraints. For example, you may not be allowed to use feature A or B that would provide an obvious solution. If you have an odd constraint, it may also help explain why you have that constraint.

Help Others Reproduce the Problem
One thing to remember is that not all questions benefit from including code. However, if you include code, definitely do not just copy in your entire program! By having irrelevant details, you make your question much harder to answer and decrease the chances of someone helping you.

Here are some guidelines for when to include code in your question.

Minimal
Include just enough code to allow others to reproduce your specific problem.￼￼ One way to do this is to restart from scratch. Do not include snippets of your entire program. Instead, create a new program, but only add what's necessary to recreate the problem.

If you aren't exactly sure where the problem code is, one way to find it is by removing code chunks one at a time until the problem disappears — then add back the last part. This way, you can deduce that the last piece of code you added back is likely the source of your problem.

Be careful not to remove too much code, either. Keep your question brief, but maintain enough context for clarity.

Complete
Make sure you include all the portions of the code needed to reproduce the problem. It would be best if you assumed that the person who is answering your question would not write any code to reproduce your issue. Again, remember, do not use images of code—those trying to help you need direct access to the code you include in your question.

Reproducible
When you include your code, it's also important to tell the reader exactly what you expect the behavior to be. Be sure to show the reader the exact wording of the error message you encountered (if there was one). It's also crucial to double-check that your included example reproduces the problem.

One other thing you can do is create a live example on a site like sqlfiddle.com or jsbin.com. If you do, make sure you also include a copy of your code in your question. Not everyone will utilize the link to the live example.

And to reiterate, do not post images of any code, data, or error messages—reserve images for things like rendering bugs—things that are impossible to describe accurately with just text.

Proofread
Don't send a question you haven't proofread. When you post your question, you should have already read and reread it, taking care to follow all the best practices and making sure your question makes sense. It would be best if you imagined that you're coming to your question fresh, with no other context but the question itself. You want to make your question as easy for someone to answer as possible. Remember, the reader is likely choosing between several questions they could answer. You want your question to stand out as something concise and approachable. Don't forget to double-check your spelling, grammar, and formatting. Keep it as straightforward as you can; you're not writing a novel.

Respond to Feedback
As feedback and responses to your question begin coming in, respond as quickly as possible. You'll likely receive clarifying questions, and your readers need that clarification to help you.￼￼￼￼
