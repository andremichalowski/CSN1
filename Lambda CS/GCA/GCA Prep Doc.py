Here we go!
What is the GCA?
The test is a standardized test made by CodeSignal consisting of 4 questions. 
The test is timed, 1 hour and 15 minutes to submit all answers.
The test is proctored meaning that both your screen and audio are recorded.
An id is required to verify the user taking the test.
Rules of the GCA?
You must remain in front of the camera during the entire duration of the test.
No one else can be present in the room you are testing in.
You may not use any other devices while testing.
You may only use a search engine to look up language “syntax”.
Pre-Strategy for the GCA?
Make sure you are well rested, have eaten, and have used the restroom beforehand. 
Find a quiet place to test, preferably at home alone.
Do not wait until the final day or hours to take the test, that just adds pressure.
Take the practice GCA weekly.

Strategy for the GCA?
Do not spend too much time on one problem if you get stuck.
Use available libraries to simplify problem solving.
You can answer each question in any available language.
Read over each question before beginning, solve easiest to hardest.
Passing some tests is better than passing none. Attempt every question.
Write out steps to solve the problem before coding, this will actually save you time.
You can submit an answer more than one time, your progress is saved.
Utilize console.log() so you can check your progress on a problem as you go.
