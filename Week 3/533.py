  A. TYPES:

    1. DIRECTED AND UNDIRECTED:
      A. Directed:
        - uni-directional
        - bi-directional
      B. Undirected:
        - no-direction

    2. CYCLIC AND ACYCLIC:
      A. Cyclic:
        - able to re-visit a vert #undirected is cyclic
      B. Acyclic:
        - not able to revisit verts 

    3. WEIGHTED:
      A. Weighted:
        - some edges have different weights

    4. DIRECTED ACYCLIC GRAPHS (DAG'S):



2. ADJACENCY LIST + ADJACENCY MATRIX:

    Graph Representations


3. IMPLEMENT USER DEFINED VERTEX AND GRAPH CLASSES THAT ALLOW BASIC OPERATIONS:
