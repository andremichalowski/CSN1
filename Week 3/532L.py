1. DEPTH FIRST TRAVERSAL ITERATIVELY: (NON RECURSIVE METHOD) (PREORDER STYLE?):

  def iter_dft(root):

      result = []

              queue.append(current.right)
  ​
      return result 



2. INORDER TRAVERSAL:

  class TreeNode:
      def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
          self.val = val
          self.left = left
          self.right = right
  ​
  def inorder_traversal(root):
      # Your code here
      result = []
      recurse(root, result)
      return result
  ​
  def recurse(root, result):
      if root is None:
          return 
  ​
      recurse(root.left, result)
      result.append(root.val)
      recurse(root.right, result)


3. (USE PRORDER AND INORDER INPUTS TO OUTPUT BINARY TREE THAT ADHERES TO BOTH)

"""
You are given the values from a preorder and an inorder tree traversal. Write a
function that can take those inputs and outputs a binary tree that adheres
to the given orderings. 
​
*Note: assume that there will not be any duplicates in the tree.*
​
Example:
Inputs:
preorder = [5,7,22,13,9]
inorder = [7,5,13,22,9]
​
Output:
    5
   / \
  7  22
    /  \
   13   9
