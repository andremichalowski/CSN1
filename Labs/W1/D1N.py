1.1 PLANNING: 

  # LABS INTRO:

  # Key Areas of Measure
  # We work closely with hiring managers to understand what they're looking for in the portfolio projects you produce. All of your work during Build Sprint and instruction culminates in delivering a real product, design, or data analysis to a real user.

  # These five key areas below are measures you may be asked about during the hiring process. Your experience in Labs will help you confidently answer questions like these: “What can you show me that demonstrates you’re ready for the job?” or “What experiences do you have that have prepared you to work on a real team?”

  # 1. Preparation
  #   “Our team did the work to understand the data, expectations, and customer need.”
  # 2. Quality Delivery
  #   “I have a quality portfolio project that I’d like to show you.”
  # 3. Strategic Alignment
  #   “Our team understood expectations and our project solves a real user’s need.”
  # 4. Contribution and Collaboration
  #   “We succeeded as a result of our teamwork and my personal contribution.”
  # 5. Problem Solving
  #   “We worked independently and as a team to overcome numerous obstacles along the way.”
